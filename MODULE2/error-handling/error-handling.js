// # Error Handling



// Errors can feel frustrating when they occur, but they are actually quite helpful in the process of programming. A good error can tell you exactly what the problem is and how to fix it. Developers will sometimes even include errors in their code as a way to signify something has gone wrong. This can be useful when others use their code.

// In this lesson, you'll learn how to create your own errors. You'll also learn how to manage errors thrown in an application, either from code you've written or when you use another person's code.

// ## Learning Objectives

// By the end of this lesson you should be able to:

// - Throw errors with the throw keyword.
// - Catch errors with a try/catch block.

// ---
// The purpose of errors

// You have likely seen a number of unintentional errors occur in your programs, such as `ReferenceError`, `SyntaxError`, and `TypeError`. These errors occur when you've made a mistake in your code. The program running your code surfaces these errors so that you know how and where your code is failing.
// let x = 1;
// x.forEach()
// However, you've also likely come across scenarios where you have returned an "error message" that is a string. For example, take a look at the following function which returns an error message.

// Kinds of errors 

// conts newVar = 10; 
  // <----- what kind of error will this throw? SyntaxError because we misspelled const

// let otherVar = true;
// otherVar.indexOf("wont work")  // <------- How about this one?  TypeError because 'otherVar' is a BOOLEAN and .indexOf() is an array method

// burrito.sauce;   // <------- What kind of error will this throw? ReferenceError because 'buritto' is never defined let alone burito.sauce


function getProductDescription(product) {
  if (!product.name || !product.priceInCents) {
    return "Product requires a name and price.";
  }

  const priceInDollars = (product.priceInCents / 100).toFixed(2);
  return `${product.name} - $${priceInDollars}`;
}



// In the function above, if the product object does not have a `name` or `priceInCents` property, a string is returned that explains the problem. Otherwise, a product description is provided.

// This function may seem fine, but imagine trying to use it. How would you know an error has occurred? Take a look at the invocations below and consider how this function could be used.


console.log(getProductDescription({ name: "Shirt", priceInCents: 2499 })); //> "Shirt - $24.99"
console.log(getProductDescription({ name: "Shirt" })); //> "Product requires a name and a price."
getProductDescription(); //> Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'name' of undefined
console.log("this should log")

// You can't just check whether or not a string is returned; whether or not the inserted object has the right keys, a string will be returned. However, you also have a case where a `TypeError` would occur.

// An ideal state for many functions is that it always returns _the same data type_, or it throws an error. This way, you always have some idea as to what to expect.

// ## Creating your own errors

// It's possible to write your own errors quit easily. The `throw` keyword expects some text to come after it which will translate to an error.

function getProductDescription2(product){
  if (!product.name || !product.priceInCents){
      throw "Product requires a name and a price."
  }
  const priceInDollars = ((product.priceInCents / 100).toFixed(2));
  return `${product.name} - $${priceInDollars}`;
}

console.log(getProductDescription2({ name: "Shirt", priceInCents: 2499 })); //> "Shirt - $24.99"
console.log(getProductDescription2({ name: "Shirt" })); //> Uncaught 'Product requires a name and price.'
console.log(getProductDescription2()); //> Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'name' of undefined

console.log("executing the rest of my code!!!!")


// The `throw` keyword stops the execution of your code like any other error would. In the function above, the function now has two states:

// 1. It returns the product description, as intended.
// 2. It throws an error.

// While this improves the function, it does create more scenarios where an error may occur. To handle this, you can use a `try/catch` block.

// ## Catching errors

// If you're expecting a function to throw an error, you may use a `try/catch` block.

//  what will happen here?

try {
    throw "this is an error";
} catch(error) {
    console.log(error);
}

// what about here?
const greaterThanTwo = (num) => {
    if (typeof num !== "number") {
        throw("Error: num is not a number in line 105")
    }
    return num > 2 ? true : false
}
// // try to run line 111 
try {
    console.log(greaterThanTwo(2))
} catch (error) {
// if we CATCH an error from 111 we run 114
    console.log(error, "<-------- this is the error message")
}

greaterThanTwo('2');

// console.log("this logs because the code will still execute even though we have an error thrown")

//------------------------------------------------------------------------//

function getProductDescription2(product) {
    if (!product.name || !product.priceInCents) {
      throw "Product requires a name and price.";
    }
    console.log("no errors keep going!")
    const priceInDollars = (product.priceInCents / 100).toFixed(2);
    return `${product.name} - $${priceInDollars}`;
  }

const product = { name: "Shirt" };
let result = null;
// notArealFunction();
console.log("we probably wont see this");
try {
    notArealFunction();
   result = getProductDescription2(product);
} catch (e) {
  console.log("An error occurred!");
  console.log(e); //> Product requires a name and price.
}

console.log("logging result");
console.log(result);

// 

// A `try/catch` block allows you to _try out some code_ and, if no errors are thrown, the code will continue on. If an error is thrown, _the error will be caught_ and some different code can be run. Then, your code will continue. A `try/catch` block is somewhat similar to an `if/else` statement: if the code works, run the code inside of the `try` block; otherwise, run the code in the `catch` block.

// For example, the code above will have the following output:

// An error occurred!
// Product requires a name and price.
// null


// Here is what is happening in the code above:

// 1. The `product` does not have a `priceInCents` key. When the function is called inside of the `try` block, an error will be thrown.
// 1. The error message is then moved to the `catch` block, and stored in the variable `error`.
// 1. The first `console.log()` statement inside of the `catch` block runs, printing `"An error occurred!"`.
// 1. The second `console.log()` statement inside of the `catch` block runs, printing the error messages from the function: `"Product requires a name and price."`.
// 1. The code continues onwards and prints the result of `result`. Because the code inside of the `try` block failed, `result` is still `null`.

// The `try/catch` block can both protect your code from errors while making it clear that at certain points in your code, you expect that something may fail.

// ### Don't just catch it all

// You should not be wrapping all of your code in `try/catch` blocks.

// Errors that occur because something's gone wrong with writing your code should be fixed. However, functions that may intentionally throw an error could be caught. Don't mistake using `try/catch` as a way to fix what is wrong with your applications.
