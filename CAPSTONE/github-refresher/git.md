# Git

## What is git?
    - A version control system.
    - Version control is the practice of tracking and managing changes to software code
## Why git?
    - Try out new ideas without breaking code that works
    - Seperate out code by role - i.e. a branch for code that goes into production, a branch for testing, branches for daily work
    - Seperate out code for new features we might want to build.
    - Try out new ideas without any commitment to the code you wrote - we can totally trash it if we need to
