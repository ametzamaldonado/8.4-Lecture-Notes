## Getting Started

The purpose of today is to
- Begin thinking of an app idea (or decide on one!)
- Do a quick 5 minute check-in with an instructor to approve your app idea (your instructor will help you navigate if your idea is too similar to other group(s))
- Create a positive work culture by planning your group work and having open communication
- Decide on Group Norms

## Your Capstone Check-list
Below is a handy checklist all the deliverables you will need during Capstone

- [ ] Pick an app idea
- [ ] Choose an app name (can be changed later)
- [ ] Write a 2-3 sentence summary of the app idea
- [ ] 5 minute check-in with instructor
- [ ] Read and discuss Working in Groups
- [ ] Create group norms (a document you will share with your team and instructor)
- [ ] Learned everyone's work hours
- [ ] Discuss best methods of communication
- [ ] Determine initial work cadence (can be changed later)
- [ ] Create a Trello board for your project
- [ ] Decide a stand-up schedule 
- [ ] Decide with instructors when your weekly review meetings will be
- [ ] Create user stories
- [ ] Create wireframes
- [ ] Create ERDs
- [ ] Create GitHub Repos
- [ ] Deploy front-end and back-end sites prior to building


## Deliverables and Dates
During this module you will be working as a team to construct a fullstack applicaiton leveraging all that you have learned over the past year at Pursuit.  Before we begin the coding journey there are still a few items we need delivered form you on canvas.  Each team is only required to submit one link on canvas but each deliverable must be met before building our app can begin.

- [ ] 11/7 Group-norms document outlining how your team will work together.  
- [ ] 11/9 App-idea approved by instructor.  
- [ ] 11/9 Link to Front-end Github repo.  
- [ ] 11/9 Link to Back-end Github repo.
- [ ] 11/13 Link to team Trello.
- [ ] 11/15 Wireframes && ERD's
- [ ] 11/16 Links to deployed back-end and front-end


### Picking an App Idea

Work together as a team to ideate at least three possible Capstone ideas. If you need some help refining your thinking refer to [Ideating](https://github.com/joinpursuit/capstone/tree/main/ideation).  By the end of the week we should have decided on an app idea and had it approved by your instructors.

Remember, unused Capstone ideas can always become personal projects.

You should choose a name (it is ok to change it later) and be able to summarize your app in 2-3 sentences.

You will do a quick check-in with your instructor to make sure you have the green light on your app idea and to continue working.

### Working in Groups

Read and discuss [Working in Groups](https://github.com/joinpursuit/working-in-groups/blob/main/README.md)

What are your takeaways?

### Creating Group Norms

Team norms are a set of rules that shape team member's interactions. These are clear agreed-upon behavior, communication, and understanding expectations of each other. This will also help you assign tasks when building your app.


Here is a summary, in case the link becomes broken in the future

1. Everyone thinks of the worst team they have been on (work, volunteer, sports team, school project)
1. Everyone takes a moment to jot some notes about why that experience was so terrible
1. Ask everyone to share
1. Everyone now thinks of the best team experience
1. Everyone takes a moment to jot some notes about why that experience was so great
1. Ask everyone to share
1. Now ask what things make a good work experience versus a bad one
1. Someone should volunteer to be a note taker - the note taker should open a google doc (or similar) and screen share so that everyone can see the list and be thoughtful about adding to it or adjusting it
1. Ask team members to suggest behaviors and norms that would contribute to the team's success
1. Discuss which ones can the team support and adhere to
1. Flag any concerns or challenges (see below)
1. Discuss how to deal with a team member who does not follow norms (see below)
1. Someone else should volunteer to take the list and create a `must do` list - this list should be shared with your whole team and your instructor. This are the norms your teams should now follow for the project.

### Challenges

All of you are in this program part-time with different external obligations. It's really important to set norms around this. A great way to frame is it for your behavioral interview: One of the biggest challenges will be everyone's different schedules. How did you handle it? How did you make it work? Think of the best ways your group can deal with this.

How do you want communication to happen? Over slack? Over text message? What are "normal work hours"? What are the hours that if someone reaches out they should not expect an immediate answer because it is "after hours". How quickly do you expect everyone to respond during "normal work hours"? If someone has another obligation (or takes a lunch break etc.) that will make them unavailable during "normal work hours" - how should they let the team know?

### Work Cadence

How does everyone work best? Do you all want to be in the same zoom room together? Would you rather work independently off zoom and do check-ins?

Understanding that everyone is expected to work on the front-end and back-end of the app at some point during the project and everyone must contribute to the code base and project in a significant way, how do you want to split up the work? Who works on what?


## Create User Stories (informal)

While talking through your app idea, write down your initial user stories that will drive your ability to create wireframes and ERDs. It is ok if these are rough ideas at this point in time.

## Create Wireframes

Choose to draw wireframes by hand or use a simple free app.

There should be one wireframe for every view of your app.

Focus on just creating wireframes for MVP.

Make sure the wireframes are accessible to everyone. Include a link on Trello for easy access.

## Create ERDs

Choose to draw ERDs by hand or use a simple free app.

Try to focus on MVP/keeping things simple.

Make sure the ERDs are accessible to everyone. INclude a link on Trello for easy access.

## Create and Set Up Trello Board

Create a Trello Board and add all the members.

Create user stories and put them all in the `backlog`.

## Get instructor approval

Show your assets that you've created to your instructor as a small presentation. Get and incorporate feedback from your instructor.

## Assign initial Tasks

Move a small number of user stories to the `to-do`. These should be the features your team can do in the span of 1 sprint.

Discuss and assign the cards to team members.

As you continue to plan and build, these cards will likely change.

## Create a Repository on Github

Create a repository and make sure everyone is added as a collaborator

### Conflict Resolution

There are many ways to handle conflicts, but here are some dos and don'ts to get you started as you make your own team norms.

#### Don'ts

- Assume the worst. If someone is unexpectedly offline, first ask if they are ok. Take time to understand the situation first
- Go over everyone's head. If you have a problem with someone your first step should not be to go to the instructor, start with your team first
- Assume that people know what is bothering you. Be sure to let people know, early and follow up if the issue is not resolved or comes up again
- Assume it will get better without talking about it
- Disappear/stop communicating. If you are not comfortable talking in person, try zoom, if not zoom, try the phone, if not the phone, try slack, if not slack, try email.

#### Do

- Keep communication open

  - Always talk to the person you are having an issue with
    - If you are not sure what to do, talk it through with a friend or a peer first, privately, use the session to develop a plan. Do not escalate unless you have already made attempts at fixing the situation yourself

- Try to resolve the conflict yourself/within the team first
- Try to be empathetic
- Listen before giving advice
- Reach out to an instructor if you can't resolve something, on your own or if the issue is bigger than what your group can solve (someone has a family emergency that will take them away from a project for a while).

Remember, your instructor wants to help you succeed and is here to support you. It's not about getting people in trouble, it's about learning to work on a team in a professional way.
