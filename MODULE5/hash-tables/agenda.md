## Where We Go From Here

Strong foundations are more important than a shaky understanding of a wider breadth of topics.

Our program has been a survey course where we have covered a wide breadth of topics. Each module could have easily been a year long.

Before entering this program, it is very possible that you did not know what a server or database was. You needed exposure to the core concepts of full-stack web development so you could know what questions to ask and what to learn next.

You have been introduced to a lot of things that you need to know about in order to get a junior level position as a developer. Your learning journey is still just beginning.

Feedback from many employers is that they are not typically impressed by watching someone create `Hello, world` in multiple languages and frameworks without the ability to do more. Nor just being able 'name drop' some latest tech or name of a data structure.

Employers tend to prefer to see someone demonstrate strong foundations within their language(s)/frameworks that they have been learning/studying.

So be sure you really know your foundations so you can keep growing in way that will align with your career growth. It is ok to go back to old material/concepts and get stronger. Should you need to learn a new language or framework, you'll find that your foundations will help you learn new things faster and better.

- [Pursuit Module 5](https://github.com/joinpursuit/Pursuit-Core-Web/tree/master/data-structures-%26-algorithms#labs-and-lessons) - don't be afraid to start again and go through the material again. Sometimes novelty in learning is beneficial, but so is going back and spending time with material again.

- [Pursuit Core Web](https://github.com/joinpursuit/Pursuit-Core-Web) - go all the way back and try to update or redo the labs and projects

- [Eloquent JavaScript](https://eloquentjavascript.net) - read about JavaScript in more depth

- [Free Code Camp](https://www.freecodecamp.org)

- [DSA in JavaScript](https://github.com/trekhleb/javascript-algorithms)

Finally, the best way to learn is to code. Keep making projects. They don't have to be great, in fact many of your early projects will be rough. That's because you are learning. Go back to your old projects and see what you've already learned. There is no shortcut or trick to avoid writing bad code, the writing of bad code is how you learn to write good or even great code.

You should have at least one showcase personal project that you are ready to show to employers: It should start very simple, look really nice in terms of CSS/UX/UI and can be quite small in scope (a single model grocery list app). Once you have built a really nice version 1, you can either try a new project that is a bit more complex or you can continue to build on top of your current project.

But you should also just be building things that grab your interest or you want to lean into your discomfort of a topic so you can level up.


Its been a pleasure to introduce you to the world of coding.
