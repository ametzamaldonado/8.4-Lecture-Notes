## BONUS CHALLENGE

 - A binary tree is a powerful tool for streamlining our search capabilites, but currently our search function is not taking advantage of that.  Take look at the search function we built in class and see if you can implement a `Binary Search` method.

 - Trees can be searched in two ways: `Depth First Search (DFS)` and `Breadth First Search or (BFS)`
 Today's lab requires that you implement __one__ of these methods.  
 See if you can imllement both.
