// Based on the reading, what is ECMAScript?
//  The scripting language that is the basis of JS.
//  an association that decides the future of JS 
//   the last version was ES6 released in 2015 was a big one with `let and const`
//  A new ES is released every year with some changes



// - What is destructuring?
//   It's a way to unpack an object or arrays 
//   destructuring lets us take the inner pieces of an object or array
//   and take them apart individually.


// - How could you use destructuring to create three new variables from the following array?

const astronauts = ["Jessica Watkins", "Robert Shane", "Nicole Mann"];
// This is the old way of declaring variables
// // let one = astronauts[0];
// // let two = astronauts[1];
// // let three = astronauts[2];

// New way, does the same thing:
const [one, two, three] = astronauts;
console.log(one, two);

// - How could you use destructuring to create three new variables that represent each key-value pair in the following object?

const astronaut = {
    name: "Jessica Watkins",
    isActive: true,
    occupation: "Geologist",
};

// Old Way:
  // let name = astronaunt.name;
  // let isActive = astronaunt.isActive;

// New Way:
const { name, isActive } = astronaut;
console.log(name); // not sure why name is crossed out but the code works!

// - What are some benefits of using destructuring? Are there any downsides?
  // Destructuring syntax can seem backwards;
  // We need to assign variable names that coincide with object keys
  // Destructuring is less code - its very efficent.

// - How can you apply destructuring to the following function?

function getAstronautActivityStatus({ name = "no name", isActive }) { // Takes these values from the object being passed.
  let result = "";
  if (isActive) {
    result = `${name} is active.`;
  } else {
    result = `${name} is not active.`;
  }
  return result;
}

console.log(getAstronautActivityStatus(astronaut)); //> "Jessica Watkins is active."

// - How can you use object shorthand to construct an object using all of the following variables?

const first = "Nicole";
const middle = "Aunapu";
const last = "Mann";
const whatever = "yes";

const wholeName = {
  first,
  middle,
  last,
}

console.log(wholeName); //> {first: 'Nicole', middle: 'Aunapu', last: 'Mann'}



// - What are some of the benefits of using object shorthand? Are there any downsides?
//   Efficency (sp?).  It's short and saves time.  
//   Readability - once we are used to object shorthand it is very clean
//   LESS CODE

// DOWNSIDES
//   It's a new syntax so some people may not be used to it
//   The key names must match varaible names EXACTLY

// - The function below expects that sometimes `name` will not be provided. How can you update the `greet()` function so that it uses default parameters?

// function greet(name = "space cadet"){
//     let results;
//     if (name){
//         result = `Welcome to NASA, ${name}!`
//     }
//     return result;
// }

// Shortened to: (don't need a result variable because we will always return a sentence. See default value)
// function greet(name = "space cadet"){
//     if (name){
//         return `Welcome to NASA, ${name}!`
//     }
// }

// Shortened to: (because a default value is being provided!)
function greet(name = "space cadet"){
    return `Welcome to NASA, ${name}!`
}

console.log(greet("Jessica")); //> "Welcome to NASA, Jessica!"
console.log(greet()); //> "Welcome to NASA, space cadet!"

// --------------------- Using different method: --------------------- //

// - Convert the `greet()` function from above to use the arrow function syntax instead of the function declaration syntax.
const greet2 = (name = "space cadet") =>  {
  return `Welcome to NASA, ${name}!`;
}

//   Is it possible to write this function on a single line?
// We can write short functions on one line like so - in do we can omit the `return` and `{}`; but the function must be on one line;

// BELOW keeps a default value: 
const greet3 = (name = "space cadet") => `Welcome to NASA, ${name}`

console.log(greet3("Kenya!!"))


// - Are there any benefits to using the arrow function syntax? Are there any downsides?
// BENEFITS!
//   Shorter!  Less code.  Readability. 
//   Less code means less error chance

// DOWNSIDES
//   return statements!  Remember that we need to return from our funcitons if they are more than one line;
//   New syntax - not everyone likes it.

// - "Rest" and "spread" share the same syntax. What is that syntax?
// ...

// - Is the code below an example of the "rest" or "spread" syntax? How do you know?
//   This is SPREAD - we are spreading the values into a new array
const beforeEarth = ["Mercury", "Venus"];
const afterEarth = ["Mars", "Jupiter", "Saturn", "Uranus", "Neptune"];
const allPlanets = [...beforeEarth, "Earth", ...afterEarth];

console.log(allPlanets); //> [ "Mercury", "Venus", "Earth", "Mars", "Jupiter", "Saturn", "Uranus",  "Neptune" ];

// Without spread the results would be 
// AKA: const allPlanets = [beforeEarth, "Earth", afterEarth];
/*
  [
    [ "Mercury", "Venus" ],  <---- notice this is still an array!
    "Earth",
    [ "Mars", "Jupiter", "Saturn", "Uranus",  "Neptune" ]  < ------ same here!
  ]
*/

// --------------------- SPREAD EXAMPLE --------------------- //

//  WE can also SPREAD objects and their key values just like we can with Arrays
const physicalRequirements = {
  visualAcuity: "20/20",
  height: "5ft",
};


const workRequirements = {
  degree: "STEM field",
  minimumYearsOfExperience: 3,
  isAlien: false,
};

const requirements = {
  mustBeUSCitizen: true,
  ...physicalRequirements, //keys in this object are "spread" into this new object
  ...workRequirements,
};
console.log(requirements)
/*
{
    mustBeUSCitizen: true,
    visualAcuity: '20/20',
    degree: 'STEM field',
    minimumYearsOfExperience: 3
}
*/

// ------------------------------------------------------------ //

// - Take a look at the code below. What do you expect will be logged to the console?
// This is REST - which is used primarily to access the REST of the arguments in a fuction
function getPlanetsCount(...whatever) {
  let result;

  if (whatever.length === 1) { 
    result = `There is 1 planet!`;
  } else {
    result = `There are ${whatever.length} planets!`;
  }

  return result;
}

const count = getPlanetsCount("Mercury", "Venus", "Earth", "Mars");
console.log(count);


// ----------------------- REST EXAMPLE ----------------------- //
// we can also use REST with array destructuring assignment 
function listAstronauts(nasaPeople) {
  const [first, second, third, ...others] = nasaPeople;
  return `${first}, ${second}, ${third}, and ${others.length} more!`;
}

const astronauts2 = [
  "Jessica Watkins",
  "Robert Shane",
  "Nicole Mann",
  "Jasmin Moghbeli",
  "Frank Rubio",
];
console.log(listAstronauts(astronauts2));
console.log("stop here")


// The function accepts an array under the name astronauts. Destructuring is then applied to this array to create a 'first', 'second', and 'others' variable. The 'others' variable is also an array of the REST of the astronauts.



// - What are the benefits of using the rest or spread syntax? Are there any downsides?
// Benefits - It's short!  Spread can also be used to CREATE A NEW OBJECT OR ARRAY
// Downsides - like all other ES6 features - it many not be the easiest to understand for some.
// With rest you do not get to dictate what the keys will be called in your new object

// - There are many ways to accomplish the same functionality in JavaScript. Why do you think new tools and syntax continue to get added to the language?
// JS changes constantly to evolve with the web.  New challenges require different tools.
//  As JS is used certain features are requested by developers that are decided upon as essential and added to ECMAscript
